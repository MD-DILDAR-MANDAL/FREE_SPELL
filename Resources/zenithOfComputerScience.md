## Preface

Welcome to _Zenith of Computer Science_. This is not just a syllabus or crash course, but a journey:

- From basic computer literacy to building real systems.
- From understanding concepts to connecting them across disciplines.
- From learning what to code to understanding why things work the way they do.

This guide is intended for my friends, students, self-learners, professionals seeking mastery, and curious explorers of computing (myself included).

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

For a strong foundation in computer science, first achieve comfort with high school algebra, then study basic linear algebra and calculus, and elementary probability and statistics. This level will enable us to grasp core CS topics without difficulty

- Introductory Discrete Mathematics: Logic, sets, relations, combinatorics, graphs, trees
- Probability and Statistics
- Linear Algebra: Matrices, vectors, transformations
- Calculus
- Number Theory & Cryptography basics

---

## 3. Core Computer Science Concepts

- Programming Fundamentals
  - Syntax
  - Control structures
  - OOP
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
  - Understand the mathematical notation and concepts used
  - Read standard reference materials
- Operating systems
- Computer networks
- Databases

---

## 4. Practical Implementation

- Compiler Design
- Programming
  - Choose a primary language and build fluency before exploring additional languages as needed
  - Practice data structures and algorithm in a programming language
- Software Engineering Principles: version control (Git), testing, debugging, documentation
- Codebase Navigation
  - Learn folder structures, navigation and how to read large codebase

## 5. Connecting Knowledge

- System Design
  - Focuses on designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems. This includes architecture planning, database design, caching strategies, load balancing, and understanding trade-offs to build real-world applications and services that can handle large traffic and data.
- Design Principles
  - Fundamental guidelines such as modularity, abstraction, separation of concerns, and SOLID principles that ensure software is maintainable, scalable, and adaptable.
- Frontend Development
  - Involves building the visible part of an application that users interact with directly. This includes designing and implementing user interfaces (UI)
- Backend Development
  - Concerns the server-side logic and infrastructure that powers applications. Backend developers build APIs, handle database operations, server logic, authentication, and business rules

## 6. Tools and Environment Mastery

- Operating environments
  - Linux terminal
- Virtualization & Containers:
  - VMware
  - VirtualBox
  - Docker
- Cloud Platforms
  - AWS basics
- IDEs and Editors
- Version Control and Collaboration
  - Github
- Documentation and Diagram tools

  - UML diagrams (class, sequence, use case diagrams)
  - Markdown for documentation (README files)
  - Tools like draw[.]io or Lucidchart

- Note-Taking & Knowledge Management

  - Tools like Notion, OneNote, Obsidian, or simple Markdown editors for organized notes, linking concepts, and project documentation

- Productivity Skills

  - Mastering keyboard shortcuts in terminals, IDEs, and editors to speed up workflows and reduce distractions
  - Use Google Dorking for advanced and efficient information retrieval
  - Develop effective AI prompting skills to maximize productivity with AI tools

## 7. Study Tips, Philosophy & Mindset

- Learn by building projects after learning the theory
- Avoid shiny object syndrome (focus on core topics until achieving a solid level of mastery)
- Balance breadth (know many areas) and depth (master a few)
- Learn how to read research papers/documentation
- Keep curiosity alive, technology evolves faster so keep on exploring:

  - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
  - Data Science & Analytics
  - Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
  - Cloud & DevOps Engineering
  - Game Development & Graphics
  - IoT & Embedded Systems
  - Quantum Computing (intro level awareness)
